Description: A collection of tools for cancer genomic data clustering
    analyses, including those for single cell RNA-seq and mutation data.
    Cell clustering and feature gene selection analysis employ maximum 
    likelihood and Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. 
    Input data set consists of RNA count matrix, gene, and cell bar code 
    annotations.  Analysis outputs are factor matrices for multiple ranks, 
    quality measures (maximum likelihood) or evidence (Bayesian) with 
    respect to rank.  The package includes utilities for downstream analyses, 
    including meta-gene identification, visualization, and construction of 
    rank-based trees for cell clusters.
